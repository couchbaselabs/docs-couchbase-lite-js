:keywords: javascript, browser, offline-first, web

== Release {major}.{minor} (November 2025)

=== New Features

==== Couchbase Lite for JavaScript

Couchbase Lite for JavaScript delivers a fully featured and supported, offline-first local database for the browser, combining secure storage, powerful querying, and seamless sync.

Build modern web applications that work reliably without connectivity, with data automatically synchronized when online.

The SDK integrates smoothly with React, Vue, Angular, and contemporary tooling, supports PWAs, and leverages IndexedDB for persistent local storage.

Developers can query local data using SQL++ with built-in powerful indexing to speed up queries—and react to changes with document, collection, and query listeners.

Security features include Web Crypto-based encryption and TLS data sync connection.

Conflict resolution is also available, with automatic handling or custom logic.

Attachments (blobs) are fully supported, replication runs over WebSockets, and the API can be used in conjunction with TypeScript definitions for schema-safe, strongly typed development.
