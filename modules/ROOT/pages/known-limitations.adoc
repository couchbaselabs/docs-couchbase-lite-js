== Overview

This page documents known limitations and constraints specific to Couchbase Lite JavaScript that affect deployment and usage in production environments.


[#backend-compatibility]
== Backend Compatibility

*Does not work with Couchbase Lite Edge Server*

CBL-JS clients cannot connect to Edge Server, which is designed only for native Couchbase Lite platforms (C, Swift, Java, Android, .NET, Objective-C).

CORS configuration is required for data synchronization using Sync Gateway or Capella App Services -- see xref:gs-prereqs.adoc#prerequisites[Prerequisites].

[#browser-environment]
== Browser Environment Constraints

*Multiple browser tabs*

Opening the same database in multiple tabs simultaneously is not recommended and may cause data inconsistencies. The SDK does not provide cross-tab synchronization or locking.

*Private browsing limitations*

Sync behavior may be limited in private/incognito modes:

* Storage quotas are smaller
* Data may be cleared when session ends
* IndexedDB persistence is not guaranteed

[#missing-features]
== Missing Features (Not Yet Available)

The following features are planned but not currently available:

*No Peer-to-Peer (P2P) sync*

Direct device-to-device replication not supported; must sync through Sync Gateway or App Services.

*No intra-database sync (dbreplica)*

Cannot replicate between local databases on same device.

*No vector search indexes*

`EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE()` and `COSINE_DISTANCE()` functions work but without index optimization, causing poor performance on large datasets.

*No full-text search (FTS) indexes*

`MATCH()` function not available; cannot perform efficient text search. See xref:compatibility.adoc#feature-limitations[Feature Limitations] for workaround options.

*Limited indexing capabilities*

No partial indexes, expression indexes, or multi-property compound indexes.

*Query limitations*

No `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, `NEST`/`UNNEST`, `COLLATE`, or `EXISTS` operators. For complete query limitations, see xref:query-n1ql-mobile.adoc#limitations[SQL++ Query Limitations].
