With Couchbase Lite for JavaScript, you can build resilient web applications that work seamlessly online and offline, with automatic data synchronization to Sync Gateway when connectivity is restored.


Couchbase Lite for JavaScript runs entirely in the browser, storing data locally using IndexedDB and synchronizing with Sync Gateway via WebSockets for secure, bi-directional replication with delta sync support.

== Why Use Couchbase Lite for JavaScript?

* **Offline-first**: Build web applications that work seamlessly without internet connectivity, automatically syncing data when back online.

* **Official Couchbase Mobile support**: The officially supported database for browser applications, providing a reliable alternative to unsupported solutions like PouchDB with Sync Gateway.

* **Modern framework integration**: First-class support for React, Vue, and Angular, with seamless integration into modern web development workflows.

* **Enterprise-grade security**: Field-level and full database encryption using Web Crypto API, with secure authentication via Basic Auth or OIDC/JWT.

* **Progressive Web App ready**: Full support for PWAs with Service Worker integration and offline caching strategies.

* **Powerful querying**: Query documents using {sqlpp} (N1QL) with support for live queries, joins, aggregations, and indexing.

* **Delta sync**: Minimize bandwidth consumption by syncing only document changes, not entire documents.

== Key Capabilities

* **Local JSON document database**: Store and query JSON documents locally in the browser using IndexedDB.

* **{sqlpp} queries**: Execute complex queries with SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and aggregation functions.

* **Live queries**: Get real-time updates when query results change, perfect for reactive UIs.

* **Bi-directional sync**: Sync data with Sync Gateway using WebSocket-based replication with automatic conflict resolution.

* **Change listeners**: React to document, collection, and replication changes with event listeners.

* **Blob support**: Store and sync binary attachments like images and files.

* **Storage management**: Built-in quota awareness and persistent storage API integration for reliable data persistence.

* **TypeScript support**: Full TypeScript type definitions with compile-time type safety for document schemas.
