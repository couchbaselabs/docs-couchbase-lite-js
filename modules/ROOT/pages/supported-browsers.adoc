[#browser-specific-considerations]
== Browser-Specific Considerations

[#chrome-considerations]
=== Google Chrome

**Strengths:**

* Excellent IndexedDB performance
* Full support for all storage APIs
* Best developer tools for debugging
* Generous storage quotas (desktop: ~10% of disk space)
* Consistent behavior across platforms

**Considerations:**

* Desktop Chrome: Very generous storage quotas
* Android Chrome: More conservative quotas on mobile devices
* Memory usage can be higher with large databases

**Storage Limits:**

* Desktop: ~60% of available disk space (or 10% per origin)
* Mobile: Varies by device, typically 50-500 MB

[#firefox-considerations]
=== Mozilla Firefox

**Strengths:**

* Strong privacy features
* Good IndexedDB performance
* Excellent developer tools
* Consistent storage behavior

**Considerations:**

* More conservative storage quotas than Chrome
* Persistent storage requires user permission
* Private browsing mode has strict storage limits

**Storage Limits:**

* Desktop: ~50% of available disk space per group
* Mobile: Typically similar to Chrome on Android

[#safari-considerations]
=== Apple Safari

**Strengths:**

* Native macOS and iOS integration
* Good security features
* Improving IndexedDB support

**Considerations:**

* Storage quota estimation less accurate
* Persistent storage requests may not be granted
* Private browsing mode severely limits storage
* iOS Safari has stricter memory management
* Storage may be cleared more aggressively

**Storage Limits:**

* Desktop: Similar to Chrome/Firefox
* iOS: Typically 50-500 MB, can be cleared without user intervention
* Private mode: Severely limited, data cleared on tab close

[#edge-considerations]
=== Microsoft Edge (Chromium)

**Strengths:**

* Based on Chromium, same behavior as Chrome
* Full feature support
* Good integration with Windows

[#testing-recommendations]
== Testing Recommendations

**Development:**

* Test primarily on Chrome/Safari during development
* Use browser developer tools for debugging
* Enable source maps for easier debugging

**Pre-Production:**

* Test on all supported desktop browsers
* Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
* Test with different storage quotas
* Test in private/incognito mode

**Production:**

* Monitor browser usage in analytics
* Track storage quota errors
* Test new browser versions promptly

[#browser-detection]
== Browser Detection

Detect browser capabilities rather than specific browsers:

[source,javascript]
----
// Check for required features
const hasIndexedDB = !!window.indexedDB;
const hasWebSocket = !!window.WebSocket;
const hasCrypto = !!window.crypto && !!window.crypto.subtle;

if (!hasIndexedDB || !hasWebSocket || !hasCrypto) {
  console.error('Browser does not support required features');
}
----

[#polyfills-and-shims]
== Polyfills and Shims

Couchbase Lite JavaScript does not require polyfills for supported browsers. If targeting older browsers (not recommended), you may need:

* IndexedDB shim (not recommended, use modern browsers)
* Promise polyfill (only for very old browsers)
* Fetch API polyfill (only for very old browsers)

WARNING: Using polyfills may result in degraded performance and unsupported configurations.

[#browser-settings]
== Browser Settings Impact

**Settings that affect functionality:**

* **Cookies disabled:** Session-based authentication will not work
* **Storage disabled:** Database operations will fail
* **Private/Incognito mode:** Storage capacity severely limited
* **Content blockers:** May interfere with Sync Gateway connections
* **CORS disabled:** Replication will fail
